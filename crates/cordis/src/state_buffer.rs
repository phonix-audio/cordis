//! Lock-free triple-buffer for publishing `SeqState` from the audio thread
//! to the GUI thread without any mutex on the hot path.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! The old path used `Arc<Mutex<SeqState>>`: the audio callback did
//! `try_lock` + `clone_from(&eng.state)` under the engine lock; the GUI
//! polled the same mutex on every redraw. Even with `try_lock` (non-blocking
//! on the audio side), the mutex cache line bounces between cores on every
//! redraw — a microsecond here and there, but the real cost is that the
//! audio thread is now touching a shared synchronisation primitive on every
//! cycle regardless. Worse, `SeqState` contains many `Vec`s, and the clone
//! happens while holding the engine lock.
//!
//! ## What
//!
//! Classic three-slot lock-free buffer:
//!
//! - The writer owns one slot privately and writes into it as often as it
//!   wants. Publishing is a single atomic RMW.
//! - The reader owns one slot privately. Reading is a single atomic RMW
//!   that swaps its slot with the "latest published" one, returning a
//!   reference into the reader-owned slot.
//! - A shared "latest published" slot sits in the middle.
//!
//! The three slot indices are always distinct, so the writer can overwrite
//! its slot freely without racing the reader, and the reader can hold its
//! reference without fear of the writer touching the same memory.
//!
//! Writer-side `publish` is **wait-free** (one `swap`). Reader-side `read`
//! is **wait-free** (one `load` + one conditional `swap`). Neither blocks
//! the other, ever. No mutex, no spinning, no allocation.
