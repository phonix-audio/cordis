//! Built-in sidechain-style amp ducker.
//!
//! Magma's PUMP-category presets pre-Phase-4 had to wire a Macro →
//! AmpGain matrix route by hand to get sidechain pumping. The
//! ducker turns that into a dedicated module: a tempo-synced AR
//! envelope on amp gain that drops to `1 - depth` on each beat
//! boundary and recovers toward 1.0 over `release_ms`. No external
//! sidechain input required — the engine's own step clock is the
//! trigger source.

/// Persisted ducker config. Lives on `MagmaPatch`.
